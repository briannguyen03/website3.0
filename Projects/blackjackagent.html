        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>
        This project evolved from a terminal-based Blackjack game written in <strong>C</strong> into an exploration of <strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</strong>. After building the core engine, I developed an AI agent to master the game using <strong>Q-learning</strong>, a model-free RL method. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The agent’s decision-making is powered by the <strong>Bellman Equation</strong>, which acts as the mathematical foundation to update Q-values based on rewards and state transitions. To ensure the bot didn't just repeat safe moves, I implemented an <strong>epsilon-greedy strategy</strong>, introducing randomness to balance exploration and exploitation during the learning phase.
        </p>

        <p>
            After training the model over <strong>100,000 simulated hands</strong>, the agent reached a <strong>41% win rate</strong>, closely approaching the statistical casino average of approximately 42%. This project highlights my ability to bridge low-level systems programming with complex algorithmic logic, specifically in the realms of state-space management and stochastic optimization.

                    <h3>What I learned</h3>
                    <p>
                        I actually started this project just to kill time on the ferry, but I wanted to see if I could train a bot that could play the game better than I could. Since I was already working in C, I decided to continue with it. So I built the framework of a simple RL agent from scratch, with no fancy libraries.
                        <br><br>
                        The learning is based around a "state" which represents every scenerio that could come up in the game. I ended up giving it three attributes to look at: the player's sum, the dealer's face-up card, and whether or not the player has a "usable" ace. Getting those three variables to map correctly to an index in a flattened array was a headache, especially with all the manual indexing you have to do in C.
                        <br><br>
                        The biggest source of frustration was the the training loop. Because C is so unforgiving, a tiny syntax error in the math wouldn't crash the program, it would just make the agent act eraticly. So seeing the win rate slowly climb toward 41% after thousands of simulated hands was really satisfying, because the agent was actually "learning" basic strategy on its own.
