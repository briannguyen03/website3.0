        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician 
        John Horton Conway in 1970.[1] It is a zero-player game,[2][3] meaning that its evolution is determined by 
        its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial 
        configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor 
        or any other Turing machine. <br> <br><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">- Wikipedia</a></strong></p>
    
        <h3 id="rules">The 4 Rules</h3>
        <p>There are only 4 rules that govern the behaviour of the cells. They are given by the following,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>

                    <h3>What I learned</h3>
                    <p>I started this project after become fasinated with Conway's game of life, and decided to code it myself in p5.js
                        <br><br>
                        The core of the project was building out a grid system where each cell updates based on a few simple rules. A cell lives or dies depending on the number of neighbors. I used 2D arrays to represent the grid and modular arithmetic to handle edge wrapping, which gave the illusion of an infinite, looping space.
                        <br><br>
                        To make it more user friendly, I also added a responsive canvas layout that adjusts to mobile, tablet, or desktop screen sizes. Seeing how a few basic rules can create surprisingly complex and evolving patterns was really rewarding, and gave me a new appreciation for simulation based systems.
